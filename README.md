Kayak aims to be a Java framework for CAN data handling. It will (in future) include the following aspects:

 * Importing .dbc files
 * Saving and loading from an own format
 * Receiving and sending of CAN frames (in different ways)
 * Parsing of frames and generating data objects
 * A GUI to watch and control busses
 
 Why Kayak?

 Because a kayak is a small lightweight and versatile boat compared to a canoe.
